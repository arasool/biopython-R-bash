'''Part 1: Loading Expression data into the Database. (15)

The file expvalues.txt is an example of how you may find normalized expression data. Each row represents a probe placed on the microarray chip (hopefully representing a gene uniquely) and each column is a different experiement.

The goal of this homework is to create a database containing the information represented in the file and then use the database to make queries. 

First load the file expvalues.txt into your R or python workspace. Now write a function in R or python that will take a dataframe(pandas dataframe in python) of experimental values and load them into the following tables:

Experiment
	expid primary key
	expname

Probes
	probeid primary key
	probename

Data
	dataid primary key
	expid foreign key
	probeid foreign key
	expvalue

It is a good idea to separate the problem into parts and tackle each part separately. Creating functions for the different tasks will help you in the future homeworks, the midterm, and the final project so donâ€™t be lazy ... do it right.

Part 2: Querying the database to calculate average expression (5)
Write a function in R or Python that calculates average value for each probeset across all experiments. For example the average value of 244901_at in all experiments is 224.8. 

There are many ways to do this but you MUST query the database for the experimental values.
